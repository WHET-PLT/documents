\section{Terminology}
\begin{enumerate}[1) ]
\item
Note: atomic element specifies a sound comprised of:
\begin{enumerate}[a) ]
\item
Duration: measured in beats (which correspond to the elapsed time interval during which the sound is present)
\item
Pitch: tonal frequency (function or discrete values?)
\item
Aplitude: volume
\item
Wavetype: 
\begin{enumerate}[$\cdot$]
\item Sine
\item Square
\item Sawtooth
\item Triangular
\end{enumerate}
\item
Wave Envelope:
\begin{enumerate}[$\cdot$]
\item Attack: ramp from silence to peak volume
\item Decay: small drop from peak to functional volume
\item Sustain: operating volume sustained from end of decay volume
\item Release: ramp down from sustain volume to silence
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item
Chord: collection of notes initiated at the same time (is this sufficient?)
\item 
Track: collection of \emph{Notes} and \emph{Chords} organized over a time interval the length of the \emph{Song}; no notes or chords are played at the same moment within a track (see song definition and think iMovie) audio tracks.
\item
Song: a collection of superimposed \emph{Tracks} that run the full length of the song (begin simultaneously and end simultaneously -- maybe track-offset is an effect? needs consideration of narrowness)
\end{enumerate}
